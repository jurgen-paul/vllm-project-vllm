#    # Do work and commit your work.

#    # Format files that differ from origin/main.

# YAPF + Clang formatter (if installed). This script formats all changed files from the last mergebase.
# You are encouraged to run this locally before pushing changes for review.

# Cause the script to exit if a single command fails
